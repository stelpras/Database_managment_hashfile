# Database_managment_hashfile
The purpose of this projecy is to understand the inner workings of
Database Systems in terms of block level management
but also in terms of record-level management. More
specifically, in the framework of the 1st task (block library already given) 
you will implement a set of functions that
handle files created based on static hashing (Static
Hash Table).
